	I am an extroverted introvert, who loves to read and draw. I am kind of reserved, but once you get to know me, I never stop talking. I love arts and nature and I am obsesssed with Taylor Swift and Charlotte Bronte. I am passionate about becoming an entrepreneur in the near future and I love socialising and networking🧚🏼
